Access to energy is critical to Africaâ€™s development and growth. Energy is the
sustenance of all economies and an enabler of better welfare; where there is a deficit in
supply, this cripples economic growth and destroys livelihoods. Due to the urgent need
to rapidly reduce carbon emissions and respond to the highly negative impact of climate
change, there is a strong push towards promoting economic diversification and value chain
development, accelerating access to energy in remote areas, and addressing the challenge
of geographically complex terrain, all of which make expansion of access to renewable
energy sources a development imperative.
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
emphasizes the imperatives of achieving universal energy access through increases in access
to renewable energy and improvement in energy efficiency.1 This is also a critical component
of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General,
which was established in 2011. This target is premised on the understanding that energy
access2 is critical to accelerate rapid economic growth, empower women, reduce poverty
and improve living conditions.
