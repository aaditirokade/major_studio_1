Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services
Indicator 7.1.1: Proportion of population with access to electricity
Institutional information
Organization(s):
World Bank (WB)
Concepts and definitions
Definition:
Proportion of population with access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to
electricity.
Rationale:
Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions of sustainable development. The
target has a wide range of social and economic impacts, including facilitating development of householdbased
income generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks.
Concepts:
Please see method of computation for more details.
Comments and limitations:
While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good starting point for tracking
household energy access, it also presents a number of limitations that will need to be addressed over
time. In many parts of the world, the presence of an electricity connection in the household does not
necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is adequate in quality and reliability or affordable in cost
and it would be desirable to have fuller information about these critical attributes of the service, which
have been highlighted in SDG7.
Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known
as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture these
broader dimensions of service quality and would make it possible to go beyond a simple yes/no measure
of energy access to a more refined approach that recognizes different levels of energy access, and also
takes into account the affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of
SDG7. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access has already been
published based on a broad consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous
international agencies working in the field. A first Global Energy Access Survey using this methodology
has already been launched and is underway expecting to yield results by early 2017. Discussions are also
progressing with the World Bank’s Household Survey Technical Working Group regarding the
mainstreaming of this methodology into the standardized household questionnaire design that will be
applied every three years in all low income countries between 2015 and 2030 as part of the broader SDG
monitoring exercise.
The adoption of this methodology will allow – over time – the more refined measurement of energy
access, making it possible to report more disaggregated information regarding the type of electricity
supply (grid or off-grid), the capacity of electricity supply provided (in Watts), the duration of service
(daily hours and evening hours), the reliability of service (in terms of number and length of unplanned
service interruptions), the quality of service (in terms of voltage fluctuations), as well as affordability and
legality of service.
Another advantage of this approach is that they can be applied not only to measuring energy access at
the household level, but also its availability to support enterprises and deliver critical community
services, such as health and education.
Methodological challenges associated with the measurement of energy access are more fully described
the Global Tracking Framework (2013) (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 75-82), and in the ESMAP (2015)
Report “Beyond Connections: Energy Access Redefined” both of which are referenced below.
Methodology
Computation Method:
Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps
in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple
modelling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2012.
This modelling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these time
periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) referenced below provides more details
on the suggested methodology for tracking access to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87).
Disaggregation:
Disaggregation of access to electricity by rural or urban place of residence is possible for all countries.
Treatment of missing values:
 At country level
Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries
have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of
electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points -
around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero
to three data points. There are 42 countries with zero data point and the weighted regional
average was used as an estimate for electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries
have between one and three data points and missing data are estimated by using a model with
region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original observation if data is available
for any of the time periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification
rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as "Estimate").
 At regional and global levels

Data Sources
Description:
Data for access to electricity are collected entirely from household surveys (and occasionally censuses),
tapping into a wide number of different household survey types including: Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS),
the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, including those by
various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities).
The World Bank is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling a metadatabase of statistics on
electricity access harvested from the full global body of household surveys. The World Bank
Electrification Database covers more than 180 countries for the period 1990-2012 and is updated
regularly.
For more information on compiling access to energy data see Global Tracking Framework report (2013)
(Chapter 2, Annex 2, page 127-129).
Data Availability
Data was collected on these indicators for the period 1990-2012 for more than 180 countries worldwide.
