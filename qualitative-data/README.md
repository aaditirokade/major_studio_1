**Assignment: Qualitative Data**

Provided infographics primarily has 2 parts
- **Part1:** Africa's access to electricity (relative to global score)
- **Part2:** Africa's contribution to the deficit of electricity access (relative to global score)


**Design decisions:**

**Color** *(reference- Map1: Transforming lives through renewable energy access in Africa)*

- Green epresents access to electricity
- Red represents deficit of access to electricity
- Shades/Tints represent the intensity

**Form**
- the infographic portrays the access to electricity for Africans in relation to the global access
- it also talks about sub-saharan Africa's contribution to the global deficit for 2014 and predicts it for 2030

This information can be effectively represented using a bar. Simple and minimal. I plan to use a map for the interactive web-based version. To keep visual consistency, bar representation is  used in part1 as well.

**Typography**
- The typeface used here is Lato sans-serif, considering the futuristic web based interactive design: The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. 
- Lato also comes in a range of weights 

**Iconography**
- Icons representaing Lit and unlit electric bulb are used in part1 *(access)* and part2 *(deficit)*
