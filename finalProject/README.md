### **Title:**
Exploring possible connection between the gap in access to electricity, population distribution and net migration for African countries. 

### **Description**

As pointed out in the survey conducted for South Africa in 2013-16, one of the factors affecting the internal migration in Africa is gap between access to electricity in rural and urban Africa. Since net migration could be an effect of various causes, this project is aimed at studying the possible connections and trends between the the net migration, access to electricity and population gap between rural and urban Africa (2012-2016). At least 110 million of the 600 million people are still living without access to electricity in Africa live in urban areas. The quality of life is affected by access to electricity and it could be one major causes of net migration.
